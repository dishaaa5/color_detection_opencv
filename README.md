# color_detection_opencv
This project demonstrates color detection in images using OpenCV and NumPy. It leverages the HSV color space to detect and isolate specific colors such as red, blue, and green in an image. The program uses color range filtering and bitwise operations to extract the detected colors and display the results in real-time.
